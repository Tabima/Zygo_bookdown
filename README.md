# Zygolife lab book

This repo includes a **very advanced draft and almost-complete version of the Zygobook based on the documents available in Google Drive**: I've added all figures (`img/`), tables and all references (`book.bib`) to the main document. All links for figures and tables SHOULD work. I have also checked that the document is HTML readable, includes a PDF (`zygolabs.pdf`), a ebook in MOBI format (`_book/zygolabs.epub_`), and can be hosted by a server (example: [Zygolabs: Zygomycete Fungi In Teaching And Research](http://people.oregonstate.edu/~tabimaj/zygo_book/)).

# Minor issues to be fixed before final version

- References in PDF are not read by pandoc.
- Error in ebook on the preface that cannot be identified.
- Probably some other small errors/mispelling/broken links that I cannot see right now
