**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Introduction</span>**

	Zoopagomycota was erected to accommodate three lineages of the former Zygomycota: Zoopagomycotina, Kickxellomycotina, and Entomophthoromycotina (Spatafora et al. 2016). The Zoopagomycotina is of particular interest, because it contains several taxa that prey on rotifers, nematodes, and amoebae. Herein, we will give a brief overview of the predatory genera and focus on three exemplar species: _Stylopage hadra_ Drechsler, _Acaulopage tetraceros_ Dreschler, and _Zoophagus insidians_ Sommerstorff. The methods provided for these three can be used for many of the other taxa. More detailed instructions can be found in _The Nematode-Destroying Fungi_, the chapter “Fungal parasites and predators of rotifers, nematodes, and other invertebrates” in _Biodiversity of Fungi: Inventory and Monitoring Methods_, and Benny (2008). Illustrations of some of these taxa can be found at zygomycetes.org and in George Barron’s image collection (https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/3956).

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stylopage hadra (Zoopagomycotina) Laboratory</span>_**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Establishing mixed cultures of nematode-trapping species of _Stylopage hadra_</span>**

In this lab we will establish cultures of _Stylopage hadra_ from soil by baiting with living nematodes. To do so, forest or agricultural soils are sprinkled onto 0.25x Corn Meal Agar (CMA, see recipe below) to make a line of soil down the center of the plate, and the prey items are added. Culturing _Stylopage hadra_ requires more time and careful observation than it does involved techniques. Within 2–3 weeks, the reproductive propagules of predatory _Stylopage hadra_ (conidia) can be observed above the surface of the media. It’s also important to note that not all soils will yield _Stylopage hadra_, so when in need collect soils from as many different areas as you can, including those with current or past agricultural activity. Productive soils may yield _Stylopage hadra_ for at least six months after initial collection if stored in a sealed jar at 4°C. For the purposes of today’s lab, we will be baiting _Stylopage hadra_ by using _Caenorhabditis elegans_ as prey.

**_Materials_**

0.25x Corn Meal Agar (CMA) plates (see recipe below)

Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates containing _Caenorhabditis elegans _(see recipe below)

Soils and/or leaf mold from forested or agricultural areas

P-1000 micropipettes

Sterile distilled water

Parafilm

**_Protocol_**

1) Acquire two 0.25x CMA plates.

2) Sprinkle soil particulates and/or leaf mold from provided jars of material onto plates to form a band of soil down the middle of the plate (about an inch thick). **NOTE:** Sterile technique is not very important here because we are literally sprinkling soil from nature onto plates.

3) Using the provided P-1000 micropipettes, pipette 1000 ul of sterile water onto a plate containing the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_. Swirl the plate around to distribute the water. Recollect the water by tipping the plate at a slight angle and pipetting up the water that accumulates at the lower edge of the plate. Pipette this water, now filled with nematodes, onto one of your 0.25x CMA plates.

5) Repeat step 3 for your other 0.25x CMA plate (i.e. 1000 ul of nematode water pipetted onto each 0.25x CMA plate).

6) Leave the plates open to allow water to evaporate before covering and parafilming.

7) That’s it! By about three weeks after establishment, the cultures you just made should be evidencing characteristic growth of nematode-trapping species of _Stylopage _(see following section for description and depiction of morphology).

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Observing predation of _C. elegans_ by _Stylopage_ _hadra_ in mixed culture</span>**

For the purposes of today’s lab, we have provided mixed cultures of _Stylopage hadra_, a nematode-trapping member of the genus, that were prepared three weeks ago in the same way as you just did above. The goal here is to get an opportunity to look at _S. hadra_ capturing and consuming nematodes and to familiarize yourself with the few characteristic structures that _S. hadra_ forms in culture. Get a culture plate and notice the areas that are circled on the underside of the plate in red sharpie. These are areas where _S. hadra_ has been seen growing.

Look around this area under a dissecting or compound microscope. You should be able to see the characteristic conidia that are produced by _S. hadra_. _S. hadra_ produces relatively large ellipsoid conidia (~50 microns) that are borne either terminally or axially on aerial conidiophores. A single conidiophore can bear anywhere from one to a few of these conidia.

Find an area where there are lots of _S. hadra_ conidiophores and focus instead on the agar surface. Do you see any captured nematodes? Depending on the stage of digestion, you may only be able to see the rough outline of what once was a nematode. Look around until you’re confident that you’ve found a recently captured nematode.

**Figure 1. **Line drawings adapted from (Drechsler, 1935a) and (Drechsler, 1937) that depict the conidial and conidiophore morphology of two genera of nematode-trapping ascomycetes (left and center) in comparison to _Stylopage hadra_ (right). Notice the grouping of uniseptate conidia in _Arthrobotrys _into large clusters. Also note the absence of internal septa in the conidia on _S. hadra_.

Now take the parafilm off of your plate and make a wet mount using the dissecting tools provided. Do your best to make sure that the captured prey item ends up on the slide. After locating the captured nematode on the microscope, take a look at it under high magnification (400x or 1000x with oil if possible). Are there aseptate hyphae attached to the nematode at any point? Can you see the characteristic swollen _S. hadra_ haustorium? Do you see hyphae inside the nematode body?

Did you get any conidia onto your wet mount? If so, notice that they should lack internal septa. This is an important diagnostic difference in between species of _Stylopage_ and other species of nematode-trapping fungi in the Ascomycota (e.g. _Arthrobotrys_ spp._ _or _Monacrosporium_ spp.). Species of _Arthrobotrys_ are commonly-isolated from soils. They produce conidia with a single internal septum that are borne in large clusters on aerial conidiophores (see **Figure 1** above). Species of _Monacrosporium_ bear a more striking resemblance to_ S. hadra_ on the dissecting microscope as a single conidium is borne apically on an aerial condiophore (see Figure 1 below). However, upon examination under the compound microscope, it should be obvious that conidia of _Monacrosporium _spp. have multiple internal septa (see **Figure 1** above). Additionally, species in the genera _Arthrobotrys_ and _Monacrosporium_ develop specialized trapping structures with varied morphology (e.g. constricting rings, adhesive networks, adhesive pegs). Recall that _S. hadra_ does not produce specialized trapping structures, but instead captures prey items onto undifferentiated, but sticky, vegetative mycelium.

**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Acaulopage tertaceros Laboratory</span>_**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Finding _A. tetraceros_ in the environment</span>**

_Acaulopage tetraceros_ is the most reported species of the genus (e.g., Jones and Peach 1959; Park 1971; Saikawa and Kadowaki 2002; Michel et al. 2014, 2015) and is easily distinguished from other members of the genus based on its four-horned spores (Drechsler 1935). It is readily recovered by plating moist soil onto weak cornmeal (Drechsler 1935) or 0.1% sea salt water agar plates (Michel et al. 2014, 2015) as done in the _Stylopage_ protocol. Drechsler recovered this species from agricultural soils containing decaying plant material (Drechsler 1935), but it seems any soil rich in organic matter is a candidate (Saikawa and Kadowaki 2002). Decaying dicot vegetable matter from streams is also a good source for a long-spored variety of this species (Jones and Peach 1959, Park 1971). Once the material is plated, parafilm and incubate the plates for a week. Begin checking the plate(s) daily inverted on a compound microscope or under a stereomicroscope with transillumination. You will first see trapped amoeba invaded with hyphae. Within a week of seeing such amoeba, you should begin to see spores.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Synopsis of Predatory Genera</span>**

**_Stylopage_**

The genus _Stylopage_ is comprised of putatively obligate predators of soil nematodes or amoebae. First described in 1935 by Charles Drechsler, the genus presently contains seventeen species and is based mostly on morphological traits (Barron, 1977; Drechsler, 1935a, 1935b, 1939; Duddington, 1955). As predatory fungi of amoebae and nematodes, species of _Stylopage_ physically trap prey items to a free-living vegetative mycelium prior to chemical digestion. Unlike some other trapping fungi that you may be familiar with, species of _Stylopage _do not produce specialized trapping structures like rings, coils, or pegs to facilitate prey capture (Drechsler, 1935a, 1937). Species of _Stylopage_ are so far uncultured under axenic conditions, the reasons for which remain unclear but could be related to their reliance on trapping for nutrition. For this reason, isolation of species of _Stylopage_ must involve maintenance and purification of highly mixed cultures.

**_Acaulopage_**

	The genus _Acaulopage_ was described in 1935 to include amoeba predators whose conidia are borne directly on the hyphae rather than on a conidiophore as in _Stylopage_ (Drechsler 1935). It contains approximately 26 species all of which prey on naked or testate amoeba. Similar to _Stylopage_, amoeba are trapped on sticky patches along otherwise undifferentiated hyphae (Drechsler 1935). _Acaulopage tetraceros_ can be kept in mixed culture with amoebe and bacteria (Michel et al. 2014, 2015).

**_Zoophagus_**

	This genus was described in 1911 based on _Zoophagus insidians_ (Sommerstorff 1911). It includes approximately five species; all but one prey on rotifers using specialized trapping structures that are similar but different to those used by rotifer-trapping ascomycetes (Whisler and Travland 1974, Morikawa et al. 1993). The genus was originally placed in Oomycota (Prowse 1954) and was later moved into Zoopagles (Dick 1990). Molecular phylogenies inferred using rDNA, however, consistently place _Zoophagus insidians_ as sister to the Kickxellomycotina (Tanabe et al. 2000, White et al. 2006).  _Zoophagus insidians_ can be kept in mixed culture with rotifers (Tanabe et al. 2000).

**_Cystopage_**

	This genus, described in 1941, traps nematodes on sticky patches along otherwise undifferentiated hyphae (Drechsler 1941). Chlamydospores are borne laterally or intercalaryly on hyphae. The genus contains approximately seven species. No species has been cultured, and molecular data does not exist.

**_Rhopalomyces_**

	The genus _Rhopalomyces_ contains approximately 11 species that prey on nematodes and rotifers.



**_Verrucephalum_**

	This monotypic genus was described in 2014 to accommodate a species observed trapping nematodes in bat dung (Degawa 2014). The spores are darkly pigmented and borne subapically on the sporangiophore (Degawa 2014). Nematodes are captured on enlarged appressoria (Degawa 2014).

**_Helicocephalum_**

	_Helicocephalum_ was described in 1891 by Thaxter to accommodate fungi that prey on adult nematodes and nematode eggs with spores borne in an apical spiral (Thaxter 1891). The number of species in this genus is uncertain as species of this genus can be confused with “helicosporus deuteromycetes” (zygomycetes.org).



**_Brachymyces_**

	This monotypic genus was described in 1980 based on _Brachymyces megasporus_ Barron. This species preys on rotifers and potentially amoeba. It was found by baiting garden soil with bdelloid rotifers. It can be distinguished by its large, brown, apically borne conidia held in clusters of 1-4 (Barron 1980).

**Introduction**

Kickxellomycotina includes several distinct groups of microscopic fungi. Fungi in this group are either saprobes, obligate symbionts of insects, or mycoparasites. The monophyly of this lineage was recently confirmed by an eight-gene molecular phylogeny (Tretter et al. 2014). Morphologically they are regularly “septate” with a disciform septal pore and a lenticular plug (Hibbett et al. 2007; Spatafora et al. 2016) and produce few-spored sporangia called merosporangia.  Saprophytic species are mainly included in the order Kickxellales and may be cultured from dung or soil.  Species of _Coemansia_ are most commonly encountered from these substrates and are recognizable by their yellow color and comb-like arrangement of sporocladia (a specialized branch of the sporophore bearing merosporangia) (Fig. 1). Most of the mycoparasitic species in Kickxellomycotina are members of Dimargaritales and are also found in dung and soil.  Similar to some members of the Zoopagomycotina, species of Dimargaritales are haustorial parasites of mucoralean hosts such as _Cokeromyces_.  They are recognized by the dense clusters of white, two-spored merosporangia at the apex of the hyphae (Fig. 1). This lab is focused on the insect-associated species of Kickxellomycotina that belong to the order Harpellales. These fungi are also known as “trichomycetes”.  Trichomycetes was formerly a class of fungi that included four orders, but molecular evidence found that two of those orders were actually protists that are not closely related to fungi (Benny & O’Donnell 2000; Cafaro 2005; Ustinova et al. 2000) (Table 1).  Now the term “trichomycetes” is used to refer to the polyphyletic group of organisms (i.e. fungi and protists) that inhabit the digestive tracts of arthropods and attach to the gut lining via a holdfast (Fig. 1).  However, due to their morphological and ecological similarities, trichomycetologists still study both the fungal and the protist groups.  Indeed, some hosts (e.g. black fly larvae) may be simultaneously co-infected with protist and fungal trichomycetes. The trichomycetes are generally considered commensals (e.g. having no negative impact on the host organism). However, some species have been reported to have insect biocontrol potential due to pathogenic effects observed on mosquito larvae by _Smittium morbosum_ as well as the development of cysts in the ovaries of some hosts (Sweeney 1981; White et al. 2006). Recently, a comparative genomic study revealed an ancient horizontal gene transfer of a ubiquitin gene from mosquito hosts to their gut endosymbiont _Zancudomyces culisetae_ for unknown reasons (Wang et al. 2016). Several hypotheses are still under testing.

The trichomycetes have been documented from almost every group of non-predaceous mandibulate arthropods including decapods (e.g. crabs, crayfish, shrimp, etc.), amphipods (e.g. sandhoppers), brachiopods (e.g. water fleas), dipterans (e.g. mosquito, black fly, and midge larvae), isopods (i.e. pill bugs or rollie pollies), ephemeropteran (mayfly) and plecopteran (stonefly) nymphs, diplopods (i.e. millipedes), coleopterans (i.e. beetles), and collembolans (i.e. springtails).  They have also been collected from diverse habitats ranging from deep-sea hydrothermal vents (VanDover and Lichtwardt, 1986) to terrestrial caves (Manier, 1964; Reeves et al., 2000) and from tropical forests (White et al., 2000) to freshwater streams or lakes (Lichtwardt et al., 2001).  Trichomycetes have been found within dissected arthropods essentially everywhere researchers have looked for them, including all continents except Antarctica (but no one has looked yet!).

	The arthropod gut is a distinctive microhabitat that has likely influenced the convergent evolution of some morphological features of fungal and protist trichomycetes – e.g. all of these organisms have a thallus-like growth form that includes a holdfast structure to attach to the gut lining.  The lining of the arthropod gut is chitinous and is shed along with the exoskeleton during molting.   This leaves a relatively short window of time for trichomycetes to colonize, grow, and reproduce in the host before they are shed with the gut (Lichtwardt 1986).

	In insects, the gut is usually structurally divided into a foregut, midgut, and hindgut (Fig. 2).  Between the midgut and hindgut are Malpighian tubules (that function like a kidney in mammals), which can help you distinguish the regions of the gut during dissections.  Different species of trichomycetes inhabit different regions of the gut.  For example, _Stachylina_ and _Harpella_ are genera found exclusively in the midgut, whereas _Genistellospora_ and _Smittium_ are only in the hindgut (Lichtwardt 1986).

**Table 1.**  Orders of fungal and protist trichomycetes and some of their features.  Note that the protist trichomycetes were recently reclassified under a different taxonomic scheme (Reynolds et al. 2017), but the older fungal names (listed here in parentheses) are still used in the online trichomycete monograph (http://www.nhm.ku.edu/~fungi/Monograph/Text/Mono.htm) (Lichtwardt et al. 2001) and online identification key ([http://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/key-server/data/0b08020c-0f0c-4908-8807-030c020a0002/media/Html/home.htm](http://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/key-server/data/0b08020c-0f0c-4908-8807-030c020a0002/media/Html/home.htm)).

	On the other hand, millipede and isopod guts are not as structurally divided, and appear more like a long, straight tube during dissection.  Protist trichomycetes are associated with millipedes, whereas either protist or fungal trichomycetes (or both!) may be found in isopods.  The most common protist trichomycete in millipedes is _Enterobryus_, which usually has long thalli of consistent width with a curved base and rectangular-shaped spores.  Protist trichomycete thalli are unbranched and aseptate (except at the tips of the hyphae where spores are being produced).  The protist trichomycetes _Amoebidium_ and _Paramoebidium_ produce dispersal amoebae as part of their asexual lifecycle that crawl a short distance, encyst, and subsequently produce cystospores (Reynolds et al 2017).

**Figure 1.**  Examples of species of Kickxellomycotina.  _Coemansia_ (A) species belong to Kickxellales and have distinctive comb-like arrangement of their sporangia.  _Dispira_ (B) species are mycoparasites in the Dimargaritales. They are typically collected from soil or dung.  _Genistellospora_ (C) species are examples of fungal trichomycetes. They are collected from the hindguts of arthropod hosts.  _Paramoebidium_ (D) species are protist trichomycetes that are also found in the hindgut of host arthropods.

**Figure 2.**  Example of an insect digestive tract.  This mosquito larva has a midgut region that is lined with a clear, chitinous peritrophic matrix.  The midgut is separated from the hindgut by the Malpighian tubules.  The hindgut also has a chitinous lining, but it is slightly more opaque than the midgut and surrounded by epithelial cells that need to be removed during dissection in order to see the trichomycetes inside the gut.  Some species of trichomycetes may grow out beyond the anus of the host and can be seen prior to dissection.

**Asexual spores**

Trichomycetes produce specialized asexual spores of varying types, including arthrospores, trichospores, and cystospores. An arthrospore is a special type of asexual spore, with a rounded rectangular shape, that is formed by the disarticulation of the thallus branches (e.g. the thallus is divided up into sections). Asellariales (an order of trichomycetes found in association with isopods or collembolans) is the only order in Kickxellomycotina known to produce arthrospores. Arthrospores have a similar shape and size compared to trichospores and are thought to be an equivalent form of generative cells (Fig. 3). Trichospores are an elongated ovoid shape with zero to many appendages that are attached to the end of the spore (Fig. 3). Cystospores are only found in the protist trichomycetes and are formed from an encysted dispersal amoeba (Fig. 4).  The main function of asexual spores is to transmit the fungus from one individual to another and increase the population.

** **

**Sexual spores**

Zygospores of Kickxellomycotina species have not been observed consistently within groups and remain unknown for some species. The zygospores that have been observed have various shapes, from globose, lanceolate or biconical, to coiled. The fungal trichomycetes typically produce biconical zygospores (Fig. 5) that may or may not have appendages.  The zygospores have a thick outer wall that is often pigmented. This tough outer wall is believed to be important for long term survival of Kickxellomycotina species during unfavorable conditions. Sexual reproduction and sexual spores in the protist trichomycetes have not been observed.



**Holdfast**

The holdfast is either a specialized basal cell of the fungal thallus or secreted by the basal cell that attaches to the gut linings of arthropods for the trichomycetes. The shape of the holdfast varies from horseshoe-shaped, disk-like, to needle shaped, and sometimes glue is produced to secure the attachment (Fig. 3).  The protist trichomycetes use a secreted glue to attach to the gut lining, which can sometimes form a cup-like or clamp-like structure (Fig. 4).

**Figure 5.**  Zygospores, the sexual spores of the fungal trichomycetes.  There are four types of zygospores produced by fungal trichomycetes, three of which are biconical (I-III), and one of which is spear-like (IV).  As with other Zoopagomycota, sexual spores are formed following the conjugation of two hyphae.  The shape of the zygospore is an important diagnostic feature for identification of fungal trichomycete species. However, zygospores have not been observed for some species.

This lab will focus on methods of collecting and identifying the fungal and protist trichomycetes in the following sections:



1. Trichomycete Host Collection
2. Host Dissection

**Figure 6.**  Examples of equipment used for collection and dissection of arthropod hosts of trichomycetes. A white tub (A) is useful for sorting aquatic insect hosts because the light background enables easier visualization of insects.  Large and small nets (B) are used for scooping hosts and debris whereas plastic pipettes (C) are useful for sucking up small insects (such as midge larvae) during sorting.  Hosts of interest are sorted and placed into plastic containers (D) along with extra water to bring back to the lab.  Fine-tipped forceps (E) and micro dissecting needles mounted on handles (F) are used for dissecting hosts under a dissecting microscope.



1. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Trichomycete Host Arthropod Collection</span>**

Many species of fungal and protist trichomycetes are commonly found in non-predaceous immature aquatic insects – e.g. mayfly and stonefly nymphs and black fly, mosquito, and midge larvae.  Other fungal and protist trichomycetes may be found in terrestrial arthropod hosts such as millipedes, isopods, and beetles.



1. **Aquatic Insect Collection**

Insect larvae may be obtained from either lentic (i.e. still water) or lotic (i.e. fast flowing) aquatic environments using the aquatic sampling net. Insect larvae may hide underneath the rocks or on debris near the bank. A successful strategy to trap arthropod hosts is to kick the rocks before netting the hosts in the flowing water. One special habitat for black fly larvae is the surface of rocks and twigs around very rapidly flowing areas. Here are several additional suggestions:



*   Scrape the rocks and sediment at the bottom of the water with your foot.
*   Hold the sampling net downstream to catch the debris.
*   Dump the contents of the net into a sorting pan with some clean water.
*   Look for host insects and sort them into smaller containers of water using a plastic pipette or forceps.
*   Mosquito larvae float near the surface of standing water pools and may be collected with a small net or scooped directly into a container.

    Sorting pans are good to check the health and condition of the hosts and move the hosts of interest to containers using the pipettes. Care must be taken not to collect predaceous insects such as perlid stonefly nymphs or phantom midge larvae because they will eat your trichomycete hosts!  Extra samples with water and debris can be stored in ziplock bags in 4˚C for future investigation (it’s always good to dissect live hosts, since the dead gut can be degraded through time).

2. **Terrestrial Arthropod Collection**

    Moist, nutrient rich habitats such as landscaped gardens, compost piles, and thick leaf litter are good places to collect millipedes, collembolans, and isopods.  Some beetles and their larvae are hosts to trichomycetes but they may be less commonly encountered.

*   Using your fingers or forceps, gently pick up the host and place in a clean container.
*   Add some organic debris to the container.
*   Make sure to keep the lid loosely closed on the container or puncture holes in the lid for air flow.
*   Store hosts in a refrigerator or at room temperature and monitor them to prevent drying out until dissection.
2. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Host Dissection</span>**

    You will need two pairs of fine-tipped forceps, one in each hand.  Dissections should be conducted under a dissecting microscope.  A link to instructional videos about insect dissections is provided in the Additional Resources section below.

                        *   Use the forceps in one hand to hold the host still and with the other forceps remove the head (Fig. 7, B).
                        *   In a drop of distilled water, use one forceps to gently grasp one of the posterior segments – two or three segments above the anus.  Use the other forceps to hold the anterior part of the body in place and gently pull the posterior segments away from the body.  If you do this carefully, you can sometimes pull out the entire digestive tract intact! (Fig. 7, C)
                        *   Move the hindgut to a slide with a clean drop of distilled water.  Use dissecting pins to gently tear the gut into small pieces (Fig. 7, D).  If the gut is full of debris that is clouding visibility, you may need to transfer the gut pieces to a new, clean drop of distilled water for further dissecting.
                        *   Shred the gut into as small pieces as possible and inspect for clumps or strands of thalli and look for spores.  Some trichomycetes grow in branched clusters of thalli that look like little trees or bouquets of flowers!
                        *   When trichomycetes are found, pick out and remove any large clumps of host tissue, as this will impede your vision of the slide on the compound microscope.
                        *   If dissecting a dipteran host (i.e. fly larvae such as black flies, mosquitoes, midges, etc.) be sure to separate the midgut into a clean water drop on a fresh slide to look for trichomycetes.  The peritrophic matrix of the midgut is a clear lining, so trichomycetes may be easily observed once the food debris is cleaned out.    To remove the food particles, gently shake the gut lining in the water drop, and if needed, lift the gut in and out of the water several times to allow the food to wash out.  Try to keep the peritrophic matrix intact if possible.

**Figure 7.**  Schematic drawing of a mayfly nymph dissection.  First remove the head of the insect using the forceps (B).  Grasp the anterior portion of the body with one set of forceps and the posterior segments (star) with the other set of forceps and gently pull the posterior away from the body (C).  The digestive tract may come out in one whole piece, but if not, make sure to dissect the body of the host to get all the gut pieces.  Move the gut to a fresh drop of water on the slide and use the dissecting pins to tear the hindgut into pieces (D) to find trichomycetes.  If dissecting a dipteran host, be sure to collect and inspect the midgut separately from the hindgut.



3. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Slide Preparation and Identification of Trichomycetes</span>**
*   Use forceps to grasp fungal tissue and put it in the center of a clean slide.
*   Add a drop of 95% ethyl alcohol to wet the specimen and minimize air bubbles.
*   Add a drop of distilled water and carefully place a coverslip on top of the fungal specimen.
*   Place one drop of lactophenol cotton blue on the edge of the coverslip and let it infiltrate completely under the coverslip (10-30 min).
*   Seal the edge using the clear nail polish to store the slide permanently.
*   Trichomycetes may be identified using online interactive keys ([http://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/key-server/data/0b08020c-0f0c-4908-8807-030c020a0002/media/Html/home.htm](http://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/key-server/data/0b08020c-0f0c-4908-8807-030c020a0002/media/Html/home.htm)) based on information about features such as the host, spore size, holdfast type, and location in the digestive tract (i.e. midgut vs. hindgut).  Protist trichomycetes will be aseptate and usually unbranched whereas fungal trichomycetes are septate and often branched.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Appendix 1:  Axenic culturing \
</span>**

Axenic cultures are important to study the physiology, morphogenesis, phylogeny, and genomics of fungi. For teaching purposes it may be useful to create a small culture collection in order to have living material for students to view in class.  Unfortunately not all taxa in Kickxellomycotina can be cultured based on our current knowledge and technology.  Kickxellales species can be cultured on MEYE agar, Harpellales species favor the BHI or TGv agar and mycoparasites (Dimargaritales) can be grown on fungal hosts (typically Mucoromycota species)_ _on plates with MEYE, PDA, or YpSs. It is worth noting that some mycoparasites (species of _Dimargaritales_, _Dispira_, and _Tieghemiomyces_) can grow without a host on a protein-rich medium (e.g. beef, egg, or swordfish) (Benny 2008; Benny et al. 2016), but they will grow slowly and sporulate weakly.  See Benny (2008) and Benny et al. (2016) for additional media recipes and culturing techniques.

The following recipes work well for culturing Kickxellomycotina species and should be supplemented with antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or streptomycin (see Benny et al. 2016):



*   BHIv/10—10 % brain-heart infusion agar + vitamins: brain-heart infusion agar (Difco), 3.7 g; thiamine-HCl, 200 μg; biotin, 50 μg; 50 agar, 15 g; glass-distilled water, 1 l (Lichtwardt 1986).
*   MEYE—malt extract-yeast extract agar: malt extract, 3 g; yeast extract, 3 g; peptone, 5 g; dextrose, 10 g; agar, 15 or 20 g; distilled water, 1 l (Benjamin 1958, 1959; Benny and Benjamin 1975).
*   PDA—potato dextrose agar: potatoes (peeled and cut), 200 g (boil extract 10 min in 700 ml distilled water, filter, adjust final volume to 1 l); dextrose, 20 g; agar, 15 g (Schipper 1969—pH 6.6; Benjamin 1958, 1959—pH not mentioned).
*   TGv—tryptone-glucose medium + salts and vitamins: tryptone (Difco), 20 g; glucose, 5 g; KH2PO4, 0.28 g; K2HPO4, 0.35 g; (NH4)2SO4, 0.26 g; MgCl2•6H2O, 0.10 g; CaCl2•2H2O, 0.07 g; thiamine-HCl, 200 μg; biotin, 50 μg; 50 g agar, 15 g; glass-distilled water, 1 l (Lichtwardt 1986).
*   YpSs—Emerson’s yeast-phosphate-soluble starch agar: soluble starch, 15 g; yeast extract, 4 g; K2HPO4, 1.0 g; MgSO4•7H2O, 0.5 g; agar, 20 g [15 g used later; Benny and Benjamin 1975]; distilled water, 1 l (Benjamin 1959).

**Chapter 5.  Zoopagomycota: Entomophthoromycotina: Conidiobolus **

Joseph W. Spatafora

_Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330._

_Conidiobolus_ (Entomophthorales) is a genus of insect pathogenic fungi in Zoopagomycotina (King 1976a, 1976b, 1977).  There are currently 46 described species (MycoBank; accessed June 29, 2017).  It is closely related to _Entomophthora_ and the “core” Entomophthorales, but molecular, but genome-scale phylogenies do not support the monophyly of _Conidiobolus_ (Gryganskyi et al. 2012, 2013). It is commonly found in forest soils and leaf litter in subtropical and tropical ecosystems.  It can be easily isolated on simple media (e.g., CMA, PDA, etc.), and thus is assumed to have a saprobic phase or as least saprobic potential in nature.  It is also an opportunistic pathogen of mammals (e.g., dogs, horses, sheep; e.g., Humber et al. 1989, Vilela et al. 2010) and humans (Chandler 2006).  Infections are most common in nasal cavities through inhalation of spores or parent soil material (Mackey et al. 2015, Rain et al. 2015).

_Conidiobolus_, as its name implies, produces ballistosporic conidia, which are the primary means of dispersal and which facilitate isolation into pure culture.  The conidia are formed on conidiophores and the forcible ejection of the primary conidium is by eversion of a columella (Fig. 1). The everted columella gives the primary conidium a nose or beaked (pyriform-spherical) appearance (Fig. 2). The primary conidium has multiple germination/dispersal options that are environmentally regulated.  They may germinate directly into hyphae (Fig. 3); germinate a conidiophore and produce a secondary conidium of approximately the same size (Fig. 4), or germinate to form multiple microconidia (Fig. 5). Some species, but not all, produce villose conidia or resting spores (Fig. 6).  Zygospores production is known from about half  the described species and they are globose, thick-walled, and smooth (Fig. 7).

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Isolation</span>

1) CMAP plates. Pour plates to a shallow depth; just enough to cover the bottom of the plate one or two millimeters.  This will help reduce contamination by other fungi, such as _Mortierella_ (see Lab # 8), which may grow up and touch the agar surface.  Antibiotics are typically not needed but can be added if desired. Note: Water agar or CMA can be substituted for CMAP.

2) Collect forest soil and leaf litter using a hand trowel.  Keep soil and leaf litter separate so as to determine better the source of the inoculum.

3) Sieve both soil and leaf through a #10 soil sieve to homogenize the particle size.

4) Label bottom of petri dish with name, date, experiment ID (e.g., soil, leaf litter, etc.).

5) Place approximately one tablespoon of sieved soil/leaf litter in the inverted lid of CMAP petri dish.  Be sure the soil/leaf litter is evenly distributed and as low as possible. Mist the soil/leaf litter but do not over water. There should be no standing water and the soil/leaf litter should not become muddy or soupy.

6) Place the agar-containing petri dish bottom on top of the wetted soil/leaf litter agar surface down.  Be sure the agar is not touching the soil/leaf litter.

7) Place the soil/leaf litter CMAP plates upside down in a moist chamber.  A moist chamber can be made with simple sealable plastic box (e.g., tuperware) with wetted paper towels in the bottom. Again, do not over water.

6) Examine the agar for spore shoots and hyphal growth every 24 hrs.  Primary conidia will have shot up from the soil/leaf litter and land on the agar surface.  They will begin to germinate and appear as small points of germinating spore and hyphae; the equivalent of a colony forming unit.

7) Transfer spore shoots and hyphal growth to fresh CMAP plates using sterile technique, parafilm, and store at ambient temperature.

8) Once growth as commenced a fresh crop of primary conidia can be observed on the inside of the petri dish lid.  Using sterile technique and a transfer loop, transfer material from the petri dish lid into a drop of water or cotton blue on a microscope slide, place a cover slip, and observed stages described above.

**Introduction**

_Basidiobolus_ (Basidiobolomycetes, Basidiobolales) is a genus of fungi with an unusual combination of life history traits and morphologies (Humber 2012).  It is most commonly isolated from the dung of insectivorous amphibians and reptiles including frogs, geckos and lizards.  Spores pass through the disgestive system of the animal and are dispersed with its dung.  _Basidiobolus_, as its name implies, produces forcibly discharged spores that are ejected from the dung.  These spores are asexual, however, and are called primary conidia or blastoconidia (Fig. 1a).  Blastoconidia are globose and have multiple germination options.  They may germinate hyphae that are septate; they may undergoe repetitive germination to produce another blastoconidium, or produce a capilloconidium (Fig. 1b).  Capilloconidia are not forcibly ejected; rather, they possess a sticky tip that adheres to small insects.  The capilloconidia are then dispersed with the phoretic insect, and when the insect is consumed by an insectivorous amphibian or reptile, the life cycle begins anew (Fig. 2). Sexual reproduction is by gametangial conjugation and zygospore formation.  Zygospores are typically smooth and thick-walled.  The zygospore forms in one of the gametangia, however, typically giving zygospores a beaked appearance (Fig. 1c).

C) Zygospores (http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Fungal _Descriptions/Zygomycetes/Basidiobolus/.

_Basidiobolus_ is a member of the Zoopagomycota but its relationship to the other subphyla is poorly resolved (Spatafora et al. 2016).  It is currently classified in the Entomphthoromycotina, but current molecular and genome scale phylogenies suggest that it might be best classified within its own subphylum (Gryganskyi et al. 2013).

_Basidiobolus_ is considered a commensal with its amphibian or reptile host but its complete ecological role in nature is unknown.  It can an opportunistic pathogen of mammals (basidiobolomycosis, Gugnani 1999) resulting in subcutaneous infections (e.g., Anaparthy & Deepika, 2014) and rare infections of the gastrointestinal tract (Geramizadeh et al. 2015).

**Fig. 2.  **Life cycle of _Basidiobolus ranarum_ (Webster and Weber, 2007).

**Isolation**

Collect appropriate animal (e.g., frog, lizard, gecko) and hold in a container until it deficates.  Containers should be a suitable size to hold the animal comfortably and humanely and allow for appropriate air exchange.  Release animal after dung collection.

1) Prepare 2% water agar plates.

2) Cut small piece (2x2 mm) of agar from water agar plates and mix with dung pellet using scapel or dissecting needles.

3) Place agar/dung mixture in the middle of the inner surface of petri dish lid.

4) Place agar containing petri dish bottom on top of the petri dish lid. Parafilm petri dish and store upside down to allow for primary conidia to be ejected on to agar surface. Examine every 24 hours for spore shoot and germination.

Or

1) Prepare 2% water agar plates.  Also pour a very thin layer of water agar in the lid half of the petri dish.  Allow agar to solidify in petri dish lid then close petri dishes.

2) Place sterile filter paper on agar surface of petri dish lid.  Moisten with dH2O but not enough to create standing water.

3) Using forceps, take a dung pellet and smear across the surface of the moistened filter paper.

4) Close petri dish, parafilm petri dish, and store upside down to allow for primary conidia to be ejected on to agar surface. Examine every 24 hours for spore shoot and germination.

5) When germination is observed, transfer germinating spore to nutrient rich agar medium (e.g., PDA)

6) Once colony has established (3-7 days depending on species) remove small amount of inoculum and place in water droplet or lactophenol cotton blue on microscope slide and gently cover with cover slip.

7) Observe the following traits: septate hyphae, conidiophore, primary blastoconidia, secondary capilloconidia, zygospores.

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) of Glomeromycotina, Mucoromycota are the most common form of mycorrhizae on the planet.  These fungi occur in all terrestrial ecosystems and form symbioses with ~74% of all plant species (Brundrett, 2009). Based on fossil data these fungi are an ancient group with early records from the Ordovician, approximately 460 million years ago (Redecker et al. 2000). Since the vast majority of vascular plant species form AM associations and they can also be found in many early-diverging and non-vascular plants, it is generally accepted that these fungi were present on the roots of the very earliest terrestrial plants. It has been hypothesized that the AM symbiosis likely facilitated the colonization of land by enhancing plant nutrition and enhancing survival (Brundrett, 2002; Bidartondo et al 2011). AM associations are particularly dominant in grasslands and prairies in temperate ecosystems as well as in tropical ecosystems including forests.  However, AM fungi can be difficult to observe due to their cryptic nature. In this lab you will learn basic techniques to isolate spores from soil (Fig. 1a) and also stain and observe arbuscles (Fig. 1b) and vesicles (Fig. 1c) of AM fungi directly in plant roots.

**AM spores** are globose to subglobose and are produced terminal or subterminal, according to species, on specialized hyphae. The spores tend to be quite large (often larger than 100 μm) and they often have refractive contents inside.  Sexual reproduction has never been documented in AM fungi and AM spores are assumed to be asexual propagules.  For this reason they have been referred to as azygospores or chlamydospore-like.  Spores are produced in the soil and typically in close proximity to the plant root.

**Arbuscules** are specialized haustoria that are formed within the cortex cells of the fine roots of plants. **Hyphae** grow along the root surface where they penetrate and grow between epidermal cells through the production of **appressoria** (Fig. 4).  A hypha will then penetrate the cell wall of cortex cells, but not the cell membrane, forming a highly branched, shrub or tree-like haustorium called an arbuscule. Arbuscules are produced by all AM fungi and are the sites of nutritional exchange between the fungus and plant. The fungus receives simple carbohydrates (glucose) from the plant and in exchange the plant receives water and nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, nitrogen, etc.) from the fungus.

**Vesicles** are not produced by all AM fungi but are frequently observed in the roots of plant hosts.  Vesicles are globose to oblong and stain a dark blue to black.  They can be produced within or between the cells of fine roots.  Vesicles are assumed to be storage organs whereby the fungus can retain nutrients inside of the plant (where they are safe from marauding soil organisms). However, the exact function of vesicles has not been definitively shown.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Collection of host plant and soil for observation of AM spores, arbuscules and vesicles.</span>**



1. _Collect an AM host plant. _(Fig. 5)
    1. Grass hosts.  Native or introduced grasses work well, but they will be colonized more heavily if collected from well-watered environments or during the rainy season.  Use a shovel or trowel to dig up grass plants making sure to collect the fine root system and ample soil.  Place the plant including roots and soil in a plastic bag and store in a refrigerator or cool place.
    2. Onions.  Onions starts also work well for observing AM fungi.  Grow onion starts in forest, grassland/prairie, or agricultural soils.  Soils can be collected and used to grow onion starts in small plastic pots.  Mycorrhizal inoculum can also be purchased at a local gardening store but it is not necessary.  Onion starts will need to be grown for 1-2 months prior to staining.
    3. Other hosts. The vast majority of vascular plants form AM associations so you can look for AM spores, hyphae, vesicles and arbuscules with almost any host plant. If no grasses or onions are available just try a convenient plant to see what you find!
2. _Soil removal._  Remove the aerial portion of the plant and place the root system in a 2L beaker with tap water.  Soak the root system to remove soil.  Gently wash root system of onion/grass plant under running tap water to remove remaining soil debris.  Do this gently so as to retain as much of the fine root system as possible.  The soil:water mixture will be used for spore isolation and the cleaned root system will be stained for arbuscules and vesicles.  Store roots in a plastic bag with a wet paper towel in a refrigerator until ready for use.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Isolating Arbuscular Mycorrhizae spores.</span>**



1. Stack three soil sieves in order of 850 um (No. 20), 250 um (No. 60) and 38 um (No. 60) from top to bottom.
2. Stir the soil:water mixture and pour onto the 850 um sieve.
3. Wash the spores and finer soil particles through the 850 um sieve using tap water.

    NOTE: Water will flow more slowly through the finer mesh sieves. Be sure not to allow water to overflow the finer mesh sieves.  If needed remove and wash spores and finer soil particles through the 250 um sieve and then the 38 um sieves.

4. Repeat until all the soil:water mixture has been filtered and wash water runs clear through 38 um sieve.
5. Collect the retained material (screening) from the 250 um and 38 um sieves into separate beakers with water from a squeeze bottle.
6. Place screenings into a 50ml round-bottom centrifuge tube and add tap water.  Screening volume to tap water should be approximately 1:2. You will have two tubes corresponding to screenings from 250 um and 38 um screenings. Balance tubes and spin for 5 min at 4000 rpm. A gentle spray of water from a squirt bottle or faucet is useful to wash the screenings into the tube and a funnel is also helpful.
7. Discard supernatant (which tends to contain dead organic materials) and retain pellet (which will contain spores). Resuspend pellet in 50% sucrose solution, mix well.  Balance tubes and spin for 5 min at 4000 rpm.
8. The supernatent contains the AM spores. Pour the supernatant over 38 um sieve and rinse gently with water to remove the sucrose.
9. Collect washed spores using a Buchner funnel and filter paper or alternatively you can pour directly into a clean petri dish.  NOTE: Perform separately for each screening so you will have two sets of filter paper, a >250 um and a >38-250 um.  Store in petri dish.
10. Make a slide mount in water of spores from the filter paper using a transfer loop. Alternatively, for spores that are in water in a petri dish you can examine the entire contents of the dish in a dissecting microscope. A small suction pipette can be used to transfer individual spores to a slide for light microscopy.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Troubleshooting.</span>**



1. Be careful not to overflow water on finer mesh screens, you will lose spores.
2. Do not leave the spores in sucrose solution for too long – they can rupture or become misshapen.

    3 Soil Sieves: 850 um (No. 20), 250 um (No. 60) and 38 um (No. 60)


    5 gal plastic bucket for washing into (optional: soil can clog drains if you are washing directly into a sink)


    Centrifuges-Sorvall RC-2B or similar centrifuge


    50 ml, round bottom tubes for Sorvall centrifuge


    Water bottles with bent spout, filled with distilled water.


    Beakers: 250 ml and 100 ml


    Petri dishes


    Rubber tube (long enough to attach to tap water faucet).


    Compound microscopes


    Dissecting microscopes


    Microscope slides


    Microscope cover slips


    Dropper bottle with dH2O


    Transfer loop


    Plastic funnel (for washing materials into 50 ml tubes)


    **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Recipes</span>**

50% sucrose (w/w) - 50 g. sucrose + distilled water to 100 ml

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Staining for Arbuscular Mycorrhizae.</span>**



1. _Loading root container._  Remove a small section of the fine root system with forceps and place in a screened, root container (Fig. 6).  Do not over-pack root container, as the roots need to be accessible to the clearing and staining reagents.  The screen will prevent the roots from being forced out of the openings of the root container.
2. _Clearing root system.  _Place root containers in 2L beaker containing 10% KOH solution and boil for 3 minutes.  Occasionally stir with metal spatula to distribute root containers
3. _Rinsing root system._  After 3 minutes of boilding, remove the root containers from the KOH using tongs and place them in a new 2L beaker. Rinse five times with tap water.
4. _Staining root system_. Place rinsed root containers in 2L beaker containing 5% Schaeffer Black ink solution and boil for 3 minutes. Occasionally stir with metal spatula to distribute root containers.
5. _Destaining root system.  _Place stained root containers in 2L beaker containing acidified water.  Rinse for 5 minutes, discard water and repeat 3 times.  This rinse can be performed under a slow running tap or on a magnetic plate with a spinner bar.  The destaining step will remove the ink from most of the plant cell but retaining it in fungal structures of hypha, arbuscules and vesicles. Occasionally stir with metal spatula to distribute root containers
6. _Slide preparation._ After destaining, remove the roots from the root container and place on a piece of foil or paper towel. Spread the roots out with forceps and place a small amount of fine roots in a drop of water on microscope slide and slowly place cover slip avoiding the introduction of air bubbles.  Gently press cover slip with blunt end of forceps.
7. _Microscopy.  _Place the slide on the compound microscope stage.  Starting with the 10X objective, find an area of roots that appears to possess concentrations of stain then adjust to higher magnification objectives as needed.  Observe hyphae, appressoria, abuscules and vesicles.

1. For the sake of efficiency, start heating KOH and Ink:Vinegar solutions at the beginning of the exercise on individual hot plates.
2. The quality of the staining will vary from root to root and sample to sample, so be persistent and make numerous slides and examine multiple fine roots.
3. Arbuscules are dynamic structures and are constantly being formed and degraded in plant roots.  Also, the clearing and staining procedure will be harsher for certain plants and roots.  For these reasons some arbuscules will appear fuzzy, but be persistent and look at as many stained cortex cells as possible for well-defined arbuscules.
4. There will likely be numerous other fungi present in the roots of these plants.  They will be typically observed as brown hyphae and other specialized cells such as hyphal coils. These are not AM fungi but are referred to as root endophytes. These are typically filamentous species of Ascomycota and their regular septa can sometimes been seen.

**I. BACKGROUND **Mortierellomycotina, (Mucoromycota) are among the most common soil fungi on the planet, and occur on all continents and terrestrial ecosystems (Wagner et al. 2013). Divergence date estimates indicate these fungi comprise a lineage that split from AM fungi and other Mucoralean fungi between 358-508 million years ago during the Cambrian-Devonian geologic periods (Uehling et al. 2017). In addition to occurring in soils, Mortierellomycotina fungi can be cultured from plant rhizospheres. However, they do not form distinctive morphological structures on or within plant roots. Consequently, they have evaded morphological detection in studies on plant-fungal interactions, and their functional interaction with plants is still not well characterized. Given Mortierellomycotina fungi are readily culturable from soils and plant roots, they are well suited for lab study and experimentation.

Mortierellomycotina fungi are characterized by producing coenocytic hyphae, although septae are formed in old or damaged hyphae (Spatafora et al. 2017). Hydrophilic mycelium is favorable for soil bacteria activity (Kohlmeier et al. 2005), which use mycelial networks for transportation and dispersal. Many species within the Mortierellomycotina are known to harbor endobacteria within their hyphae. The origin and functioning of these endosymbiosis is still open to debate (Uehling et al. 2017).

Mortierellomycotina fungi can be difficult to observe in nature due to the cryptic nature of these microfungi. However, species in this lineage can be readily isolated from soil, roots or dung for study. They often exhibit rapid growth making them suitable for laboratory and experimentation. Still some species within Mortierellomycotina have evaded isolation, or exhibit only limited growth. In this lab, you will learn basic techniques to isolate these fungi from soil and also stain, observe and study these fungi in pure culture and with microscopy.

Here are some structures that you are likely to encounter:



*   **Sporangium (Figure 2) **(pl. sporangia)** **are enclosed vessels that produce asexually produced sporangiospores, and a born upon terminal hyphae known as sporangiophores. Single or multiple spores can be produced within a sporangium, and some species fail to produce sporangia (e.g. _M. chlamydospora_).
*   **Columella (Figure 2)** is a sterile tissue found at the tip of a sporangiophore that forms a septum between the active protoplasm below and the developing spores inside the upper portion of the sporangial head. The columella of Mortierellomycotina fungi characteristically is flat or slightly convex.
*   **Sporangiospores (Figure 2) **are globose to subglobose and elongated are produced terminal or subterminal, according to species, on specialized hyphae. Sporangiospores are mitotically produced and tend to be small (often larger than 2-10 μm). Spores are produced on sporangia in the soil.
*   **Chlamydospores (Figure 3) **are asexually produced spores that form intercalary within or between hyphal cells, or sometimes on terminal hyphae. These structures are generally thick walled and serve as resting spores when resources become limited or conditions unfavorable.
*   **Zygospores (Figure 4) **are sexual spores produced by many species of Mortierellomycotina, yet zygospores are not frequently observed. Zygospores can be  produced by homothallic species, or by heterothallic species when they mate. Mating appears to occur under low nutrient conditions.
*   **Stylospores (Figure 5) **are highly ornamented, hyaline, asexual reproductive propagules.

**II. CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES **

1)_ Smelling and observation station _



1. Observe the morphological variation and aroma of different isolates of _Mortierella _either harboring or without bacterial endosymbionts. Collect a ballot and describe the smell of each fungal culture. We will compare and discuss the results as a class. This exercise can be modified for isolates that have not been analyzed for endobacterial presence, as _Mortierella _have a characteristic scent.
2. Observe the characteristic rosette like concentric rings of _Mortierella_ cultures. This growth form is characteristic for the group **(Figure 1). **

2)_ Collect soils, dung, or fresh plant roots to use for _Mortierella _isolation_



1. _Soils_. Fresh or even dried soils work well for isolating _Mortierella_. Use a spoon, knife or hand trowel to collect a handful of mineral soil below leaf litter. Place soil in a plastic, wax or paper bag. Soils can be air dried or stored in a refrigerator or cool place and later used for baiting experiments detailed below.
2. _Dung_. _Mortierella _can be isolated from animal dung. Herbivore dung is preferable, but different species of these fungi can also be isolated from dung obtained from omnivores and frass obtained from insects.  Fresh or air-dried dung samples can be used.
3. _Roots & non-vascular plants_. Use a shovel, trowel or rake to dig up plant roots taking care to collect fine roots. Non-vascular plants can also be collected. Place the plant or roots in a plastic bag together with some field soil or a wet paper towel to keep moist and store in a refrigerator or cool place until use.

3) _Isolation of Mortierellomycotina._


    _a. Substrate Baiting_. Many kinds of substrates can be used to bait _Mortierella _out of soils. Because many species of _Mortierella _are able to break down chitin, shrimp or crab exoskeletons works well for baiting _Mortierella _out of soils. This approach is successful due to the expansion in gene families involved in chitinolytic metabolism (Uehling et al. 2017). Other substrates that have been used successfully to bait for _Mortierella _include hibiscus hips and dried insects. Baits are first boiled in water and then autoclaved before use. Baits are then placed on top or gently nestled into moistened soil in a petri dish (**Figure 6).** Soil should be moistened just enough to promote growth, standing water will cultivate other microbial growth. Petri dishes are then sealed and incubated at room temperature. After 1 week, plates are open and shrimp skeletons are removed with forceps, rinsed under tap water, washed in 0.1% solution of tween 20 and then surface sterilized by soaking in hydrogen peroxide for 1 minute. Inoculated and surface sterilized baits are then placed on fresh MEA plates, often with antibiotics (see trouble shooting below) and incubated at room temperature, upside down. that incubation temperature for _Mortierella_ isolation – 5C is selective for many _Mortierella_ species. Conspecific isolates can be paired to produce zygospores, and often form asexual spores in monoculture conditions. Slides can be prepared by mounting tissues in water or KOH, and adding dyes such as Congo red or Nile blue to more easily visualize hyphae and spores.


    _b. Soil particle isolation. _Many soil collections contain _Mortierella _and related fungi. A particularly successful isolation technique is to use an inverted agar plate to catch spores ejected from fungi found in soil particles. A soil sample is sprinkled (~.25 grams fresh soil) is sprinkled on the inverted lid of a petri lid from a dish containing agar media. After ~3 days the soil is removed and the plate sealed with parafilm to avoid contaminants.

5) _Cytoplasmic streaming. _Prepare a slide of _Mortierella _for live cell imaging by applying a thin layer of media on a microscope slide. Inoculate the edge with a small agar block and incubate overnight in a moist chamber. To view, remove agar block with a razor and gently apply a coverslip. At high magnification you can see vesicle trafficing. Which direction do vesicles flow? Do they cell contents stream at the same rate?

6) _Lipid staining. _Stain live _Mortierella _slides with ‘Oil Red O’ to observe lipid trafficking.

**Chapter 9.  _Pilobolus_ (Mucoromycotina, Mucoromycota)**

Joseph W. Spatafora

_Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97330._

_Pilobolus _(pilos (Gr.) = felt, skullcap + bolus (Gr.) = ball) is a common coprophilous member of Mucorales that can be used to demonstrate phototropic sporangiophore and forcibly discharged sporangia.  In this laboratory you will learn to setup a dung chamber, identify _Pilobolus_ and the main characters associated with its asexual reproduction, and establish cultures.

**Dung collection.**

Just about any form of herbivore dung will work. I have had best results working with dung collected from wild deer, elk and rabbit, but horse also works well if they are grazing in pastures with _Pilobolus_.  Collect fresh dung that is still moist and not desiccated into a plastic ziplock bag.  Use plastic gloves to collect the dung and label the bag with collection information (e.g., host, locality, date, collector).  Place the dung into a refrigerator to keep cool or until you are able to setup the dung chambers.  Typically dung is collected the day before so that storage is not more than 24 hours.

**Dung chamber set up and incubation.**

A dung chamber can be made from any available sealable container, such as a clean medium size plastic container in which you typically purchase cottage cheese, yogurt or salsa.  The wider the mouth of the container the better, as it will make handling easier, and you want it tall enough to hold the dung, but not too tall to prevent examining under a dissecting scope.  Fold a paper napkin into a shape so that it fits in the base of the container.  Wet the napkin with tap water so that it is saturated but pour off any standing water.  Place a small (60 mm) petri dish lid (or bottom) open side up, inside the container on the saturated paper napkin.  The petri dish lid/bottom will serve as a stage to hold the dung.  Place enough dung onto the Petri dish stage to fill it.  This will typically be 3-5 pellets of deer dung or one piece of horse dung.  Mist the dung with a small amount of water.  Close lid and incubate at room temperature for 24-48 hours.

**_Pilobolus_ observation.**

_Pilobolus_ sporangia are macroscopic and readily observed with the naked eye.  Sporangiophores are erect and elevate the sporangium off the surface of the dung.  Sporangiophores are typically 1-3 cm in length, but can be much longer in some cases.  They are anchored in the dung by a swollen base called a trophocyst.  The sporangiophore terminates in a subsporangial vescicle (SV); the sporangium is formed atop the SV and is the “hat” of _Pilobolus_.  At the junction between the sporangiophore and SV is a carotinoid ring (CR) that is used to detect light and orient the sporangium towards the light.  The SV focuses the light increasing the turgor pressure within the SV, resulting in the sporangium being forcibly ejected from the tip of the SV.  The sporangium is shot towards the light, and thus the light gap, increasing the efficiency of dispersal.  Sporangia can be shot up to 2 meters and the sporangial flight represents some of the fastest speeds and strongest g-forces documented in nature (Yaffetto et al. 2008; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEj8uidzP4I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEj8uidzP4I)).  Sporangia stick onto vegetative, are consumed by grazing herbivores, pass through the digestive tract of the host animal, and are deposited with the dung starting the whole process over again, a phenomenon called gut-passage syndrome.

**Slide preparation.**

Place a drop of water onto a standard glass microscope slide.  Using a blunt dissecting needle, gently excavate the dung from around the base of the sporangiophore so that the trophocyst is exposed.  Lift the sporangiophore from the dung and place it in the droplet of water on the microscope slide.  Gently apply a cover slip and observe under a compound light microscope.  Starting at the base of the structure observe the trophocyst, sporangiophore, carotenoid ring, subsporangial vesicle and sporangium.  You will likely notice many sporangia that have been discharged and are stuck to the sides of the container.  Using your dissecting needle pick a few and make a microscope slide as described above.  Observe under a compound microscope and then break the sporangium by applying pressure to the cover slip with the eraser end of a pencil.  Observe again to see the individual sporangiospores contained with each sporangium.

![alt_text](images/ZyGoLabs-09July201728.png "image_tooltip")


**Isolation and culturing.**

Some species of _Pilobolus_ can be cultured on simple media such as B-agar but others require more complicated agar with dung, coprogen, or hemin (Hesseltine et al. 1953, Leventin & Caroselli 1976).  Also, the fact that _Pilobolus_ forcibly ejects its sporangia facilitates its isolation.  Pick a sporangium from the walls of the dung chamber using a flame sterilized dissecting needle.  Place the sporangium in 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 sec, then transfer the sporangium to sterile H<sub>2</sub>O for 30 sec. Sterilization can be performed in large droplet on a plastic surface (e.g., parafilm) or in adjacent wells of a spot plate.  Then transfer the surfaced sterilized sporangium with a flame sterilized dissecting needle to agar plates.  To further avoid contamination by bacteria the agar plates can be amended with antibiotics, typically a combination of Streptomycin and Ampicillin.  Observe daily for germination.  The hyphae will appear to emerge from the sporangium but are actually germinating sporangiospores.  Hyphae tend to be large diameter and sparse.  Sporangia typically start to appear within one to two weeks of hyphal growth.

**Introduction.**

Sexual reproduction in fungi was first described in zygomycetes (Blakeslee 1904) and it is among the Mucorales that it is best studied. Species may be homothallic (selfing) or heterothallic (outcrossing), a term first coined by Blakeslee.  In the heterothallic species mating occurs between isolates of the opposite mating type as determined by the mating type genes.  In Mucorales this is determined by the presence of either sexP (+) or sexM (-) gene at the mating type locus (Alexopolous 1996).  In homothallic species, both genes are presumed to be incorporated into the same genome.

**Figure 1.** _Phycomyces_ life cycle from Bergman et al 1996.

Early studies demonstrated that sexual reproduction is under pheromonal control (Burgoff 1924).  Briefly, sexP (+) and sexM (-) strains release precursors of trisporic acid that are recognized by the opposite mating type and converted into trisporic acid.  This initiates a positive feedback loop that involves the build up of trisporic acid and an increase is production of carotenoids, which results in the production of more trisporic acid precursors.  The accumulation of trisporic acid inhibits asexual reproduction and induces zygospore formation.  The products of sexP and sexM genes likely function in the regulation of numerous pathways that control sexual reproduction and it is speculated that it is mating-type specific pheromones control zygotropism.

Sexual reproduction initiates with the transformation of hyphae into zygophores, which are modified, slightly curved hyphal tips that are often rich in β-carotene.  Zygophores from + and – mating types are zygotrophic, that is they grow towards each other. The tips of the zygophores enlarge and touch forming progametangia.  The point at which the two progametangia meet and fuse is called the fusion septum (Fig. 2b).  A gametangial septum forms near the tip of each progametangium resulting in the delimitation of a gametangium, the terminal cell of the zygophore, and a suspensor cell, the penultimate cell of the zygophore (Fig. 2b). The fusion septum dissolves resulting in plasmogamy of the + and – gametangia and the formation of a multinucleate prozygosporangium (Fig. 2c).  The prozygosporangium will enlarge and become pigmented and ornamented characteristic of the species (Fig. 2d).  The zygospore forms inside of the zygosporangium and is the site of karyogamy and meiosis, ultimately form a germ sporangium with numerous sporangiospores.



**Figure 2.** Example stages of sexual reproduction in _Phycomyces_. A) Culture plate of _Phyomyces_ types inoculated with + and – mating types after 4 days. Note lines of zygosporangia production. B) Early stage sexual reproduction showing gametangial and fusion septa, and young gametangia and suspensor cells. C) Breakdown of fusion septum and formation of prozygosporangium. D) Mature zygosporangium with appendages and suspensor cells.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Procedure </span>

_Phycomcyes blakeseeanus_ is a dung fungus that forms pronounced, easily recognized sporangiophores, is highly light sensitive, and has been used as model system for studies of phototrophism, gravitropism, carotenoid synthesis, zygomycete cell biology & sexual reproduction (Bergman 1969). In this lab, you will mate + and – minus strains of _P. blakesleeanus_ and observe the multiple stages of sexual reproduction.  Mating in fungi is often affected by environmental factors such as nutrition and light.  For this reason, we will perform matings on nutrient poor agar, half-strength corn meal agar, and incubate our mating pairs in the dark.



1) Prepare separate plates of + and – strains as a source of inoculum.  These can be maintained on a relatively nutrient rich agar such as PDA.

2) Prepare half-strength corn meal agar (1/2 CMA) plates.

3) Using a sterile loop or dissecting needles, inoculate + strain at the north and south quadrants of a ½ CMA plate. (Fig. 3)

4) Using a sterile loop or dissecting needles, inoculate - strain at the east and west quadrants of a ½ CMA plate. (Fig. 3)

**Figure 3.**  Schematic of mating inoculation plate.  + strains inoculated in N and S quadrants; - strains inoculated in E and W quadrants.  After incubation in dark at room temperature, mating will demarcated by interaction lines between the two mating types.

5) Seal plates with parafilm and place in dark at room temperature.  Be sure that the container is a dark as possible.

6) After 3-5 days formation of gametangia and 7-10 days for zygospore formation can be observed at the interface where mycelium contacts opposite mating type at the boundary of a sector (Fig. 2a, Fig. 3).  Use a dissecting microscope to observed the interaction zones between + and -  mating types.
