## Overview of Kingdom Fungi

Fungi are frequently described as four groups – chytridiomycetes, zygomycetes, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes – that are defined by morphologies associated with reproduction.  The chytridiomycetes are recognized based on their production of zoospores, characterized by a single posterior, whiplash flagellum. The zygomycetes are characterized by gametangial conjugation and the production of zygospores (Fig. \@ref(fig:zygomorph)a), aseptate (coenocytic) hyphae, and asexual reproduction typically by sporangia (Fig. \@ref(fig:zygomorph)b). The ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are diagnosed by the production of asci and basidia, respectively, possession of regularly septate hyphae, and a dikaryotic nuclear phase in their life cycle. The classification of Kingdom Fungi used here recognizes eight phyla (Fig. \@ref(fig:ftol), Table \@ref(tab:fungal-class)) with the chytrids comprising three paraphyletic lineages including Cryptomycota/Microsporidia, Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota. The zygomycetes are also paraphyletic and are classified in two phyla, Zoopagomycota and Mucoromycota. The monophyly of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes has been confirmed and they are classified as phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, respectively, of the subkingdom Dikarya. 

## Zygomycete fungi

Genome-scale phylogenies do not support the monophyly of zygomycetes and reject the zygospore as a synapomorphy for them (@Spatafora_2016). Rather the zygospore, as it is currently defined, arose in the MRCA of Zoopagomycota, Mucoromycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and lost in the MRCA of Dikarya (Ascomycota+Basidiomycota).  Most zygomycetes are characterized by coenocytic hyphae and sporangial asexual reproduction, but lineages exist that are characterized by septate or compartmentalized hyphae (Fig. \@ref(fig:zygomorph)c) and/or asexual reproduction by formation of conidia (Fig. \@ref(fig:zygomorph)d). Importantly, it is with the emergence of the zygomycete fungi that we observe a loss of the fungal flagellum and the rise of the terrestrial, filamentous fungi. It is assumed that this loss of the flagellum in Kingdom Fungi corresponds to the transition to terrestrial environment and the emergence of terrestrial ecosystems. 

## Zoopagomycota 

Zoopagomycota is sister to Mucoromycota+Dikarya. It comprises three subphyla, Zoopagomycotina, Kickxellomycotina and Entomophthoromycotina. The primary ecologies of the phylum include pathogens and commensals of animals, parasites of other fungi and amoebae, and rarely as plant associates. The placement of Zoopagomycota as sister to the remainder of nonflagellated fungi suggests that diversification with animals and nonplant hosts occurred at least as early as diversification with terrestrial plants.  Also, the loss of the flagellum in fungi corresponds to other modifications including the loss of the centriole. Most nonflagellated fungi of Mucoromycota, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota possess an organelle unique to fungi, the spindle pole body (SPB), which serves as the microtubule organizing center necessary for chromosome segregation during nuclear division.  In contrast, Zoopagomycota lineages retain a functional centrosome that possesses a degenerate 9+2 microtubular system (@McLaughlin_2015). There is some evidence that _Olpidium_, a genus of zoosporic fungus that retains its flagellum and infects nematodes and plant roots of Brassicaceae, may be closely related to Zoopagomycota (@Sekimoto_2011). 

Zoopagomycotina contains a single order Zoopagales (Ch2, Ch3). Species of the order include predators of nematodes (e.g., _Stylopage_) and nematode eggs (e.g., _Rhopalomyces_), predators of amoebae (e.g., _Stylopage_, _Zoopage_), and mycoparasites of mucoralean fungi (e.g., _Syncephalis_). Hyphae are small in diameter, coenocytic, and they form haustoria on or within their hosts. Asexual reproduction is by conidia or sporangia according to species, and where known sexual reproduction is by production of zygospores. Many of these fungi are obligate symbionts and thus difficult to obtain in axenic culture, and for this reason there exists a paucity of molecular and genomic data. 

Kickxellomycotina comprises four orders, Asellariales, Dimargaritales, Harpellales and Kickxellales (Ch2, Ch4). Species of Kickxellomycotina possess hyphae that are regularly compartmentalized by bifurcate septa that are occluded by a lenticular plug (Fig \@ref(fig:zygomorph)c). Asellariales and Harpellales (Ch4) are associated with digestive tracts of aquatic stages of arthropods and comprise two of the four orders that have been treated previously as Trichomycetes (Lichtwardt 1986); the other two orders, Amoebidiales and Eccrinales, are members of Mesomycetozoea, not Kingdom Fungi (@Benny_2000, @Cafaro_2005). Asellariales has filamentous, branched thalli and reproduce asexually by disarticulation of the thalli into arthrospores (Ch 4). They occur in the digestive tracts of marine, aquatic and terrestrial species of isopods and Collembola where they are thought to function as commensals. Harpellales has branched or unbranched filamentous thalli and reproduce by trichospores, asexual spores with hair-like appendages (Ch. 4). They attach to the hindgut of aquatic stages of arthropods via a holdfast and are generally considered to be in a commensal relationship with their host. Dimargaritales species are haustorial parasites of other fungi with the best-known species occurring on mucoralean hosts (@Benjamin_1965), and Kickxellales (Ch 2) includes mycoparasites and saprobes isolated from soil. Both Dimargaritales and Kickxellales produce unique sporangia called merosporangia (Fig. \@ref(fig:zygomorph)e). These are cylindrical sporangia that arise from a bulbous structure, and one or more sporangiospores may occur in chains within the sporangium.

Entomophthoromycotina (Ch. 5, Ch. 6) contains three classes each with a single order: Basidiobolomycetes and Basidiobolales, Entomophthoromycetes and Entomophthorales, and Neozygitomycetes and Neozygitales (@Humber_2012, @Benny_2014, @Spatafora_2016). These fungi are associated with animals as either commensals isolated from animal dung or as pathogens and parasites of insects. Many species are commonly isolated from soil and maintained in pure culture, which is consistent with a saprobic life cycle phase. Basidiobolales is typically isolated from amphibian dung although species are known to occur on the dung of other vertebrates. They produce conidiophores that forcibly eject a primary conidium, which if it lands on an appropriate substrate will germinate to form a mycelium, or if not, undergo repetitive germination, producing a second conidium (Ch 6). Under some conditions nonforcibly discharged capilliconidia are produced from forcibly discharged primary conidia. Capilliconidia adhere to the outer surface of insects. Dispersal is then achieved when spore-carrying insects are ingested by insectivorous animals, and after surviving gut passage, the fungus is subsequently excreted with the feces. The phylogenetic placement of Basidiobolales with molecular and genome scale data is problematic. In all current datasets, it is characterized by long and unstable branches and its relationship to other Entomophthoromycotina is unambiguous at this time (@Gryganskyi_2012). Entomophthorales, literally, insect destroyers, comprises pathogens of insects. Like Basidibolales, they also produce forcibly discharged conidia (Ch 5). They infect their hosts via spores and multiply within the host as one to two-celled hyphal bodies, which also can function as gametangia. Upon the host's death, the fungus ruptures through the cuticle segments producing forcibly discharged primary conidia. Frequently, infected hosts alight in perched or elevated positions, a phenomenon known as summit disease, which is thought to be an induced behavior or adaptation for spore dispersal of the pathogen (@Gryganskyi_2017). Neozygitales are pathogens of insects and mites. They were classified as a family within Entomophthorales, but were distinguished from Entomophthorales based on shape and size of chromosomes (@Humber_2012), although inadequate molecular data currently exist to test this hypothesis. _Neozygites_ produces adhesive capilliconidia similar to that of _Basidiobolus._

## Mucoromycota

Mucoromycota consists of three subphyla including Glomeromycotina, Mortierellomycotina and Mucoromycotina. Unlike Zoopagomycota, Mucoromycota is characterized by plant associations and plant based ecologies (e.g., mycorrhizae, root endophytes, decomposers, etc.). Some do exist as parasites of animals and other fungi, but these all represent opportunistic infections of hosts with compromised immune systems or relatively recent derivations from saprobic ecologies (@Hoffmann_2013). Mucoromycota is the sister group to Dikarya, which is also characterized by dominant plant associated life styles, suggesting that the MRCA of Mucoromycota and Dikarya corresponds to the origin of modern fungal-plant associations, or at least the evolutionary potential for such relationships.

Glomeromycotina (Ch. 7) consists of the arbuscular mycorrhizae and _Geosiphon_, a symbiont of cyanobacteria (@Redecker_2014). Arbuscular mycorrhizae are the most common form of mycorrhizae on the planet, and arbuscule fossils are present among the first land plant fossils (@Taylor_2015), confirming an ancient symbiosis. As such they are a central taxon in the development of hypotheses concerning the evolution of early land plants and terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this importance, they have been an enigma with respect to phylogenetics of Kingdom Fungi. Morphologically, they resemble zygomycetes in the production of coenocytic hyphae and terminal or subterminal spores that resemble azygospores, asexually formed zygospore-like structures produced terminally on a single hypha or suspensor cell. Sexual reproduction has never been observed for the group, preventing analysis of morphological characters traditionally used in classifications. Early molecular phylogenies based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU DNA) resolved the arbuscular mycorrhizae – with varying statistical support depending on the analysis – as separate from the zygomycetes and sister to Dikarya (@Sch_2001). However, genome-scale phylogenies and genome content analyses strongly support the arbuscular mycorrhizae as a member of Mucoromycota (@Spatafora_2016). Currently there are four orders of Glomeromycotina, Archaeosporales, Diversisporales, Glomerales and Paraglomerales with _Geosiphon_ being classified in Archaeosporales (@Redecker_2014). 

The relationship of Glomeromycotina to the other subphyla of Mucoromycota is unresolved, with some analyses resolving it as sister to Mortierellomycotina+Mucoromycotina, while others resolve it as sister group to Mortierellomycotina (@Spatafora_2016). The taxon sampling for both Glomeromycotina and Mortierellomycotina is sparse and expanded taxon sampling is needed to fully test these rival hypotheses. Mortierellomycotina, and its sole order Mortierellales, are commonly isolated soil fungi (Ch 8). They produce zygospores and sporangia similar to some species of Mucorales, the order in which they were previously classified, but molecular phylogenetics (@Hoffmann_2011) and genome-scale (@Spatafora_2016) phylogenies both strongly support the taxon as representing a distinct subphylum. These fungi have been demonstrated as root endophytes of plants, but their effect on the host fitness remains unknown. Mortierellales are also prolific producers of fatty acids, in particular arachidonic acid. Both Glomeromycotina and Mortierellomycotina possess intimate relationships with bacteria, and while facultative, show high levels of specificity and cospeciation (@Bonfante_2017), the fungus tends to grow better when cleared of the bacterium (@Uehling_2017). 

Mucoromycotina (Ch 9, Ch 10) contains the remainder of known zygomycete species and is classified in three orders: Mucorales, Umbelopsidales and Endogonales (@Spatafora_2016). Mucorales is one of the more commonly isolated groups of fungi, as many are fast growing, early colonizers of carbon rich substrates. Because many species culture relatively easily, Mucorales are well represented in culture collections and their zygospores and sporangia are well documented. They include taxa that cause economically significant pre- and postharvest diseases of fruits (e.g., _Gilbertella, Mucor, Rhizopus_). They also significantly impact humans both beneficially through their use in industrial production of food (e.g., tempeh, _Rhizopus_) and compounds used as food supplements (e.g., beta-carotene, _Blakeslea_), and antagonistically as rare but increasingly diagnosed human mycoses (e.g., _Mucor, Apophysomyces_). It is among Mucorales that sexual reproduction in fungi was first demonstrated and numerous species of Mucorales exhibit phototropic responses to light (Ch. 9, Ch. 10), making them important eukaryotic model organisms (e.g., _Mucor mucedo, Phycomyces blakesleeanus_). Umbelopsidales was recently described for _Umbelopsis _(@Spatafora_2016), a genus of soil-inhabiting fungi that also occurs as root endophytes. Endogonales are saprobic or ectomycorrhizal depending on the species (81).  Saprobic species occur in heavily decayed woody substrates while mycorrhizal species associate with both early diverging land plants and vascular plants (Fig. \@ref(fig:zygomorph)f, Bidartondo et al. 2011). They have been argued as important organisms in the colonization of land by green plants (Field et al. 2014) and represent an independent origin of mycorrhizae relative to both Glomeromycotina and Dikarya.
