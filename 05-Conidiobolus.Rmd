## Introduction

_Conidiobolus_ (Entomophthorales) is a genus of insect pathogenic fungi in Zoopagomycotina (@King_1976, @King_1976B, @King_1977).  There are currently 46 described species (MycoBank; accessed June 29, 2017).  It is closely related to _Entomophthora_ and the “core” Entomophthorales, but molecular, but genome-scale phylogenies do not support the monophyly of _Conidiobolus_ (@Gryganskyi_2012, @Gryganskyi_2013). It is commonly found in forest soils and leaf litter in subtropical and tropical ecosystems.  It can be easily isolated on simple media (e.g., CMA, PDA, etc.), and thus is assumed to have a saprobic phase or as least saprobic potential in nature.  It is also an opportunistic pathogen of mammals (e.g., dogs, horses, sheep; e.g., @Humber_1989, @Vilela_2010) and humans (@Chander_2017).  Infections are most common in nasal cavities through inhalation of spores or parent soil material (@Mackey_2015, @Jain_2015).

_Conidiobolus_, as its name implies, produces ballistosporic conidia, which are the primary means of dispersal and which facilitate isolation into pure culture.  The conidia are formed on conidiophores and the forcible ejection of the primary conidium is by eversion of a columella (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig1)). The everted columella gives the primary conidium a nose or beaked (pyriform-spherical) appearance (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig2)). The primary conidium has multiple germination/dispersal options that are environmentally regulated.  They may germinate directly into hyphae (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig3)); germinate a conidiophore and produce a secondary conidium of approximately the same size (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig4)), or germinate to form multiple microconidia (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig5)). Some species, but not all, produce villose conidia or resting spores (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig6))).  Zygospores production is known from about half  the described species and they are globose, thick-walled, and smooth (Fig. \@ref(fig:ch5fig7)).

## Isolation

### Supplies

- Hand trowel
- Plastic ziplock bags
- Marker
- No. 10 Soil sieve
- CMAP plates
- Water mister
- Moist chamber

### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Corn meal agar with peptone (CMAP)</span>

- 17g corn meal agar (Difco)
- 5 grams peptone (Becton-Dickerson)
- 1 L dH2O

## Procedure

1. CMAP plates. Pour plates to a shallow depth; just enough to cover the bottom of the plate one or two millimeters.  This will help reduce contamination by other fungi, such as _Mortierella_ (see Lab # 8), which may grow up and touch the agar surface.  Antibiotics are typically not needed but can be added if desired. Note: Water agar or CMA can be substituted for CMAP.

2. Collect forest soil and leaf litter using a hand trowel.  Keep soil and leaf litter separate so as to determine better the source of the inoculum.

3. Sieve both soil and leaf through a #10 soil sieve to homogenize the particle size.

4. Label bottom of petri dish with name, date, experiment ID (e.g., soil, leaf litter, etc.).

5. Place approximately one tablespoon of sieved soil/leaf litter in the inverted lid of CMAP petri dish.  Be sure the soil/leaf litter is evenly distributed and as low as possible. Mist the soil/leaf litter but do not over water. There should be no standing water and the soil/leaf litter should not become muddy or soupy.

6. Place the agar-containing petri dish bottom on top of the wetted soil/leaf litter agar surface down.  Be sure the agar is not touching the soil/leaf litter.

7. Place the soil/leaf litter CMAP plates upside down in a moist chamber.  A moist chamber can be made with simple sealable plastic box (e.g., tuperware) with wetted paper towels in the bottom. Again, do not over water.

8. Examine the agar for spore shoots and hyphal growth every 24 hrs.  Primary conidia will have shot up from the soil/leaf litter and land on the agar surface.  They will begin to germinate and appear as small points of germinating spore and hyphae; the equivalent of a colony forming unit.

9. Transfer spore shoots and hyphal growth to fresh CMAP plates using sterile technique, parafilm, and store at ambient temperature.

10. Once growth as commenced a fresh crop of primary conidia can be observed on the inside of the petri dish lid.  Using sterile technique and a transfer loop, transfer material from the petri dish lid into a drop of water or cotton blue on a microscope slide, place a cover slip, and observed stages described above.
